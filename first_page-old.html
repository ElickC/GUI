<!--91.461 Assignment: Creating Your First Webpage

    Description of my webpage: I tried to balance out the images and colors while encorporating as
    much of the concepts in class as I could while throwing in some new ideas from w3schools. Most
    of the CSS is externalized, I couldn't figure out how to externalize the picture style. I'm
    looking forward to being able to add JS to my page.

    I used the HTML5 Living Validator (http://validator.nu/) for validation.

        <!-- Tidbit about my co-op with their logo/link to their webpage -->
        <p>I had the good fortune of working at Kronos last year where I got
           to experience a full release development cycle of their cloud based
           product, which was really exciting!</p><a href="https://www.kronos.com/">
             <img src="pics/Kronos.jpg" alt="Kronos" style="width:100px;height:100px;border:0;"></a>
           <br>
        <p>My first week at Kronos was basically spent on w3schools, it's a great resource.</p>
